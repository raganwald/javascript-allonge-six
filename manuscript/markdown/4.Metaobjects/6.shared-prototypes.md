## Singletons and Shared Prototypes

We can create a very simple object and associate it with a prototype:

~~~~~~~~
const Person = {
  fullName: function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  },
  rename: function (first, last) {
    this.firstName = first;
    this.lastName = last;
    return this;
  }
};

const sam = Object.create(Person);
~~~~~~~~

This associates behaviour with our object:

~~~~~~~~
sam.rename('sam', 'hill');
sam.fullName();
  //=> 'sam hill'
~~~~~~~~

There is no way to associate more than one prototype with the same object, but we can associate more than one object with the same prototype:

~~~~~~~~
const bewitched = Object.create(Person);
bewitched.rename('Samantha', 'Stephens');
~~~~~~~~

Although they share the prototype, their individual properties (as access with `this`), are separate:

~~~~~~~~
sam
  //=> { firstName: 'sam', lastName: 'hill' }
bewitched
  //=> { firstName: 'Samantha', lastName: 'Stephens' }
~~~~~~~~

This is very convenient.

### prototype chains

Consider our `HasCareer` mixin:

~~~~~~~~
const HasCareer = {
  career: function () {
    return this.chosenCareer;
  },
  setCareer: function (career) {
    this.chosenCareer = career;
    return this;
  }
};
~~~~~~~~

We can use it as a prototype, of course. But we already want to use `Person` as a prototype. What can we do? Obviously, we can combine `Person` and `HasCareer` into a "fat prototype" called `PersonWithCareer`. This is not great, a general principle of software is that entities should have a single clearly defined responsibility.

Even if we weren't hung up on single responsibility, another issue is that not all people have careers, so we need one prototype for people, and another for people with careers.

The catch is, another principle of good design is that every piece of knowledge should have one unambiguous representation. The knowledge of what makes a person falls into this category. If we were to add another method to `Person`, would we remember to add it to `PersonWithCareer`?

Let's work from two principles:

1. Any object can have an object as its prototype, and any object can be a prototype.
2. The behaviour of an object consists of all of its own behaviour, plus all the behaviour of its prototype.

When we say *any* object can have a prototype, does that include objects used as prototypes? Yes. Objects used as prototypes can have prototypes of their own.

Let's try it. First things first:

~~~~~~~~
const PersonWithCareer = Object.create(Person);
~~~~~~~~

Now let's mix `HasCareer` into `PersonWithCareer`:

~~~~~~~~
Object.assign(PersonWithCareer, HasCareer);
~~~~~~~~

And now we can use `PersonWithCareer` as a prototype:

~~~~~~~~
const goldie = Object.create(PersonWithCareer);
goldie.rename('Samuel', 'Goldwyn');
goldie.setCareer('Producer');
~~~~~~~~

Why does this work?

Imagine that we were writing a JavaScript (or other OO) language implementation. Method invocation is incredibly messy, full of special optimizations and so forth, but perhaps we only have ten days to get it done, so we might proceed like this without even thinking about prototype chains:

~~~~~~~~
function invokeMethod(receiver, methodName, listOfArguments) {
  return invokeMethodWithContext(receiver, receiver, methodName, listOfArguments);
}

function invokeMethodWithContext(context, receiver, methodName, listOfArguments) {
  const prototype;

  if (receiver.hasOwnProperty(methodName)) {
    return receiver[methodName].apply(context, listOfArguments);
  }
  else if (prototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(receiver)) {
    return invokeMethodWithContext(context, prototype, methodName, listOfArguments);
  }
  else {
    throw 'Method Missing ' + methodName;
  }
}
~~~~~~~~

Very simple: If the object implements the method, invoke it with `.apply`. If the object doesn't implement it but has a prototype, ask the prototype to implement it in the original receiver's context.

What if the prototype doesn't implement it but has a prototype of its own? Well, we'll recursively try that object too. Conceptually, this is what happens when we write:

~~~~~~~~
goldie.fullName()
  //=> 'Samuel Goldwyn'
~~~~~~~~

In theory, the JavaScript engine walks up a chain starting with the `goldie` object, followed by our `PersonWithCareer` prototype followed by our `Person` prototype.

### trees

Chaining prototypes is a useful technique, however it has some limitations. Because objects can have only one prototype, You cannot model all combinations of responsibilities solely with prototype chains. The classic example is the "W" pattern:

Let's consider three prototypes to be used for employees in a factory: `Laborer`, `Manager`, and `OnProbation`.

All employees are either `Laborer` or `Manager`, but not both. So far, very easy, they can be prototypes. Some laborers are also on probation, as are some managers. How do we handle this with prototype chains?

![Labourers, Managers, and OnPobation](images/w.png)

Well, we can't have `Laborer` or `Manager` share `OnProbation` as a prototype, because then *all* laborers and managers would be on probation. And if we make `OnProbation` have `Laborer` as its prototype, there's no way to have a manager also be on probation without making it also a laborer, and that's not allowed.

Quite simply, a tree is an insufficient mechanism for modeling this relationship.

Prototype chains model trees, but most domain responsibilities cannot be represented as trees, so we must either revert to using "fat prototypes," or find another way to represent responsibilities, such as mixing metaobjects into prototypes.

### prototypes and mixins

We've seen how to use `Object.assign` to mix functionality directly into objects. Protoypes are objects, so it follows that we can mix functionality into prototypes. We used this technique when we created the `PersonWithCareer` shared prototype.

We can extend this technique when we run into limitations with prototype chains:

~~~~~~~~
const Laborer = {
 // ...
};
const Manager = {
 // ...
};
const Probationary = {
  // ...
};

const LaborerOnProbation = Object.assign({}, Laborer, Probationary);
const ManagerOnProbation = Object.assign({}, Manager, Probationary);
~~~~~~~~

Using mixins, we have created prototypes that model combining labor/management with probationary status.

### caveat programmer

Whether we're using prototype chains or mixins, we're introducing coupling. As discussed in [Mixins, Forwarding, and Delegation](#mixins), prototypes that are brought into proximity with each other (by placing them anywhere in the same chain, or by mixing them into the same object) become deeply coupled because they both have complete access to an object's private internal state through `this`.

To reduce this coupling, we have to find a way to insulate prototypes from each other. Techniques like private mixins or forwarding, while straightforward to use directly on an object or through a singleton prototype, require special handling when used in a shared prototype.

### shared prototypes and private mixins

The standard way for a method to query or update the receiver's state is for it to be evaluated in the receiver's context, so that it can use `this`. This is automatic for simple methods that are defined in the receiver or its prototype.

But when a method has its context bound to another object (via `.bind` or some other mechanism), its state will be independent of the receiver. This is a problem when two or more objects share the same method via a shared prototype.

Let's revisit our "private mixin" pattern:

~~~~~~~~
function extendPrivately (receiver, mixin) {
  const privateProperty = Object.create(null);

  for (let methodName in mixin) {
    if (mixin.hasOwnProperty(methodName)) {
      receiver[methodName] = mixin[methodName].bind(privateProperty);
    };
  };
  return receiver;
};

const HasCareer = {
  career: function () {
    return this.chosenCareer;
  },
  setCareer: function (career) {
    this.chosenCareer = career;
    return this;
  }
};

twain = {}
sam = {};

extendPrivately(twain, HasCareer);
extendPrivately(sam, HasCareer);

twain.setCareer('Author');
sam.setCareer('Director');

twain.career()
  //=> 'Author'
sam.career()
  //=> 'Director'
~~~~~~~~

We're privately extending a domain object. When we call `extendPrivately`, a new object is created to hold the private state. We call it once for each object, so each object has its own private state for `HasCareer`

Now let's try it with a shared prototype:

~~~~~~~~
const Careerist = Object.create(null);
extendPrivately(Careerist, HasCareer);

twain = Object.create(Careerist);
sam = Object.create(Careerist);

twain.setCareer('Author');
sam.setCareer('Director');

twain.career()
  //=> 'Director'
sam.career()
  //=> 'Director'
~~~~~~~~

There is only one private state, and it is associated with the prototype, not with each object. That might be what we want, it resembles the way "class methods" work in some other languages. But if we want private state for each object, we must understand that a private mixin cannot be applied to a shared prototype.

### subordinate forwarding and shared prototypes

The mechanism for forwarding works for any object. It could be a metaobject designed just to implement some functionality, it could be another domain object, it works for anything.

One common pattern is called *subordinate forwarding*. When there is a strict one-to-one relationship between a forwarding object and a forwardee, then the forwardee is a *subordinate* of the forwarding object. It exists only to provide behaviour for the forwarding object.

Subordinate forwarding is appropriate when the state encapsulated by the forwardee is meant to represent the state of the forwarding object. Unless we are modeling some kind of joint and several ownership, an investor's portfolio is subordinate to the investor.

When people talk about modeling behaviour with composition, they are often thinking of composing an entity out of subordinate objects, then using mechanisms like forwarding to implement its behaviour.

When a single object forwards to a single subordinate, this works well. But as with private mixins, we must be careful when attempting to use forwarding with a shared prototype: All of the methods in the prototype will forward to the same object, therefore every object that uses the prototype will forward to the same object, not to their own subordinates. Therefore they will not have their own, separate state.

### safekeeping for private mixins {#safekeeping-for-private-mixins}

Our problem with private mixins is that they place the private state in an object shared by the methods in the mixin. But when the methods are mixed into a shared prototype, every object that delegates to those methods is sharing the methods, and this sharing that one shared state.

Let's rewrite our `extendPrivately` function to store the private data in safekeeping:

~~~~~~~~
let number = 0;

function safeExtendPrivately (prototype, mixin) {
  const safekeepingName = "__" + ++number + "__";

  for (let methodName in mixin) {
    if (mixin.hasOwnProperty(methodName)) {
      (function (methodName) {
        prototype[methodName] = function () {
          var context = this[safekeepingName],
              result;
          if (context == null) {
            context = {};
            Object.defineProperty(this, safekeepingName, {
              enumerable: false,
              writable: false,
              value: context
            });
          }
          result = mixin[methodName].apply(context, arguments);
          return (result === context) ? this : result;
        };
      })(methodName);
    };
  };
  return prototype;
}
~~~~~~~~

We're storing the context in a hidden property within the receiver rather than sharing it amongst all the methods.

Let's try it, we'll create a shared prototype called `Careerist`, and we'll mix in `HasName` and `HasCareer`. To make sure everything works as expected, we'll use two different objects delegating to `Careerist`, and we'll make sure that both `HasName` and `HasCareer` both try to modify the `name` property:

~~~~~~~~
var HasName = {
  name: function () {
    return this.name;
  },
  setName: function (name) {
    this.name = name;
    return this;
  }
};

var HasCareer = {
  career: function () {
    return this.name;
  },
  setCareer: function (name) {
    this.name = name;
    return this;
  }
};

var Careerist = {};

safeExtendPrivately(Careerist, HasName);
safeExtendPrivately(Careerist, HasCareer);

var michael    = Object.create(Careerist),
    bewitched = Object.create(Careerist);

michael.setName('Michael Sam');
bewitched.setName('Samantha Stephens');

michael.setCareer('Athlete');
bewitched.setCareer('Thaumaturge');

michael.name()
  //=> 'Michael Sam'
bewitched.name()
  //=> 'Samantha Stephens'

michael.career()
  //=> 'Athlete'
bewitched.career()
  //=> 'Thaumaturge'
~~~~~~~~

Our new function also works for old-fashioned extending:

~~~~~~~~
var coder = {};

safeExtendPrivately(coder, HasName);
safeExtendPrivately(coder, HasCareer);

coder.setName('Samuel Morse');
coder.name()
  //=> 'Samuel Morse'
~~~~~~~~

Of course, the new function has more moving parts than the old one, and that's why we build these things up as we go along: If we start with a simple thing, we can add functionality on a piece at a time and build up to something that covers many general cases.

This pattern simplifies things by reverting to the "overwrite" policy for methods. A more robust implementation would incorporate a *conflict resolution policy*, a subject we will not tackle here.
