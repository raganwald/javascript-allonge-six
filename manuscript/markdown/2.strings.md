# A Warm Cup: Basic Strings and Quasi-Literals

Like most programming languages, JavaScript also has string literals, like `'fubar'` or `'fizzbuzz'`. Special characters can be included in a string literal by means of an *escape sequence*. For example, the escape sequence `\n` inserts a newline character in a string literal, like this: `'first line\nsecond line'`.

There are operators that can be used on strings. The most common is `+`, it *concatenates*:

    'fu' + 'bar'
      //=> 'fubar'
      
String manipulation is extremely common in programming. Writing is a big part of what makes us human, and strings are how JavaScript and most other languages represent writing. 

### quasi-literals

JavaScript supports *quasi-literal strings*, a/k/a "Template Strings" or "String Interpolation Expressions." A quasi-literal string is something that looks like a string literal, but is actually an expression. Quasi-literal strings are denoted with back quotes, and most strings that can be expressed as literals have the exact same meaning as quasi-literals, e.g.

    `foobar`
      //=> 'foobar'
      
    `fizz` + `buzz`
      //=> 'fizzbuzz'

Quasi-literals go much further. A quasi-literal can contain an expression to be evaluated. Old-school lispers call this "unquoting," the more contemporary term is "interpolation." An unquoted expression is inserted in a quasi-literal with `${expression}`. The expression is evaluated, and the result is coerced to a string, then inserted in the quasi-string.

For example:

    `A popular number for nerds is ${40 + 2}`
      //=> 'A popular number for nerds is 42'

A quasi-literal is computationally equivalent to an expression using `+`. So the above expression could also be written:

    'A popular number for nerds is ' + (40 + 2)
      //=> 'A popular number for nerds is 42'
      
However, there is a big semantic difference between a quasi-literal and an expression. Quasi-literals are expressions that resemble their result. They're easier to read and it's easier to avoid errors like the following:

    'A popular number for nerds is' + (40 + 2)
      //=> 'A popular number for nerds is42'
      
### evaluation time

Like any other expression, quasi-literals are evaluated *late*, when that line or lines of code is evaluated.

So for example, 

    const name = "Harry";
    
    const greeting = (name) => `Hello my name is ${name}`;
    
    greeting('Arthur Dent')
      //=> 'Hello my name is Arthur Dent'
      
JavaScript evaluates the quasi-literal when the function is invoked and the quasi-literal inside the function's body is evaluated. Thus, `name` is not bound to `"Harry"`, it is bound to `'Arthur Dent'`, the value of the parameter when the function is invoked.

This is exactly what we'd expect if we'd written it like this:
    
    const greeting = (name) => 'Hello my name is ' + name;
    
    greeting('Arthur Dent')
      //=> 'Hello my name is Arthur Dent'
